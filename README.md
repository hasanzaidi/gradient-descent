# gradient-descent
Repo for demonstrating gradient descent algorithms used in Machine Learning in Python 3.

## Files included
`non_vec_batch.py` - Non-vectorised implementation of batch gradient descent

`non_vec_batch.py` - Non-vectorised implementation of batch gradient descent

`batch_and_stochastic` - Vectorised implementation of stochastic gradient descent and batch gradient descent

## Set Up
These Python scripts only require the numpy library to be installed:
```
pip3 install numpy
```
